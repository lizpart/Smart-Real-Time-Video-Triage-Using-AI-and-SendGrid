# Alternative using uvicorn directly
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Access the Application
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Allow camera and microphone access when prompted
4. Click "Start AI Monitoring" to begin

## üß™ Testing the System

### Health Check
Visit `http://localhost:8000/health` to verify all services are connected:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "openai": "connected",
    "assemblyai": "configured",
    "sendgrid": "configured",
    "agents": {
      "data_capture": "active",
      "analysis": "active",
      "report": "active"
    }
  },
  "workflow": "multi-agent system operational",
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

### Test Analysis
1. Start monitoring from the web interface
2. Speak clearly into the microphone (describe any symptoms)
3. Ensure good lighting for video capture
4. Check that all three agents activate in sequence
5. Verify results appear in the analysis panel

## üéØ Multi-Agent Workflow

- Check internet connection
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted

#### "Analysis error: API request failed"
- Verify OpenAI API key and billing status
- Check if you have access to GPT-4 Vision
- Monitor API rate limits

#### Email notifications not working
- Verify SendGrid API key and permissions
- Ensure sender email is verified in SendGrid
- Check spam folder for test emails

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting in .env:
```env
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
DEBUG=True
```

### Performance Optimization
- Close other browser tabs to free memory
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Use good lighting for better video analysis
- Speak clearly and close to microphone

## üìä Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Positioning**: Sit 2-3 feet from camera with good lighting
2. **Audio**: Speak clearly and describe symptoms in detail
3. **Environment**: Use in quiet space for better audio quality
4. **Monitoring**: Allow multiple analysis cycles for comprehensive assessment
